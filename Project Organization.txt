Project Organization:

--> Resource naming:

separate web app functionalities into folders, with naming conventions like index, view, create, delete, ... e.g:

views:
  |-> notes:
  |	|-> create.php
  |	|-> view.php
  |	|-> delete.php
  |	|-> index.php
  |-> observation:
	|-> index.php
		.
		.
		.

--> configuring the web app to redirect all requests to the index.php, which redirects after to the router. in order to take control over resources that can be accessible by visitors

--> using namespaces to specifically define a class (namespace folder_name, use folder_name/class)







extract(<array['key' => 'value']>) //convert an array to a set of variable in the form $key = value

spl_autoload_register( function($class) { ... } ) //function where we should define how a class should be required

str_replace('<old_char>','<new_char>',$string) //replace all occurences of old_char on a string

<form methode = 'POST'>
  <button .......></button>
</form> //synatx to create a button, submit a post request to the current page if clicked
